WuWei is a toolkit for building Ajax web pages and web sites in Common Lisp. It's designed to be light-weight, a toolkit rather than a platform.

Features:
* Continuation-based AJAX user interfaces 
* Server-side DOM operations (add/remove elements, visual fades, drag and drop) 
* High-level interfaces to in-place-editing and autocomplete widgets 
* Login and session management
